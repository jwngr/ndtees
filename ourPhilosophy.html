            <p class="generalParagraphText">
                At <span class="boldGreenText">NDTees</span>, our mission is to provide a seemless end-to-end shirt creation, purchasing, and delivery experience to students on campus. Find a shirt you like on the marketplace, and chances are we could have the shirt in your hands by the end of the next day! Have a cool shirt idea? Submit it to us! We'll invest in your idea, bringing the overall price down for you. Then, we'll sell and deliver the shirt for you, and you get more back than you put in! Check back often for new shirts as we update the page. You can also find us on <a id="facebookLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/NDTees/177844792281613">Facebook</a> or follow us <a id="twitterLink" href="https://twitter.com/#!/NDTees">@NDTees</a>.

            <p class="generalHeader">Why?</p>
            <p class="generalParagraphText">
                Because making a Facebook group for the shirt, collecting information publicly, investing your own money making it, charging $15 to $20 bucks per shirt, AND dealing with delivery JUST SUCKS. Going from the idea in your head to the idea on the backs of 1,000 students shouldn't be as hard as it is.

            <p class="generalParagraphText">
                Needless to say, we think it could and should be done better. And that is why we created <span class="boldGreenText">NDTees</span>. We are providing students with an online marketplace for shirt designs which is quick and easy to use. We promise to always have one of the shirts in the marketplace selling for just $10, thus <span class="boldGreenText">The $10 Shirt</span>! Needless to say, with a shirt that only costs $10 even, we can outfit a good chunk of the student population with the best shirts for every occasion without breaking their banks.
