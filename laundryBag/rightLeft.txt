In the battle over where to sit in South Dining Hall, the winner is clearly right left. It just makes more sense! You have convenient access to the tray machine, you're not being looked down upon by the Jesus table, and it simply rolls off the tongue better. Next time you eat at SDH, do yourself a favor and sit right left.
